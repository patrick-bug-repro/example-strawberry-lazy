# Strawberry Lazy Example Project

This project demonstrates the use of Strawberry Lazy to resolve cyclic
dependencies in a GraphQL API developed with Strawberry for Python.

## Installation

Ensure you have PDM installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install pdm

```

Then, to install the project dependencies, run:

```sh
pdm install
```

## Usage

Run the application with:

```sh
Copy code
pdm run python main.py
```

This will run the example query to show the use of Strawberry Lazy to resolve
cyclic dependencies.
